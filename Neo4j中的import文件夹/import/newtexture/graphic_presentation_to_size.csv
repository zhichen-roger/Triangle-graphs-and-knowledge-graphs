226,204,Histograms are bar diagrams constructed by plotting individual weight percent (frequency) along the ordinate and the phi size of each size class along the abscissa.,Graphic presentation
227,204,"As the abscissa, one may use either millimeters (in which case he must use semi-log paper) or phi units (ordinary ""squared"" arithmetic paper). The ordinate is an arithmetic scale running from 0 to 100%; grain size is plotted on the abscissa with coarser particles to the left (this is customary in all size analysis plots). Cumulative percentages of the sediment are plotted on this graph.",Graphic presentation
228,204,The frequency curve represents in essence a smoothed histogram in which a continuous bell-shaped curve takes the place of the discontinuous be read for it,Graphic presentation
229,204,M and C are respectively used as symbols of the median and the one percentile. These values are readily obtained by intersecting the cumulative curve at the 50 percent and the one percent lines and reading the diameters equivalent to these percentile values. The sediments of an environment are represented on a diagram by plotting C against M for each sample. The resulting sample point pattern is called pattern CM,Graphic presentation
