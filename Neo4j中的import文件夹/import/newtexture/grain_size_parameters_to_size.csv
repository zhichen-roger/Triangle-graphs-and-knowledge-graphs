230,204,"Half of the particles by weight are coarser than the median, and half are finer. It is the diameter corresponding to the 50% mark on the cumulative curve and may be expressed either in Phi or mm (MdPhi or Mdmm)",Size Parameters
231,204,"The best graphic measure for determining overall size is the graphic mean, give by the formula Mz=(Phi16+Phi50+Phi84)/3",Size Parameters
232,204,"Given the formula (Phi84-Phi16)/4+(Phi95-Phi5)/6.6, This formula includes 90% of the distribution and is the best overall measure of sorting. It is simply the average of (I) the standard deviation computed from Phi16 and Phi84, and (2) the standard deviation as computed from Phi5 and Phi95-- since this interval (from 5 to 95%) embraces 3.30Phi, the standard deviation is found as (Phi195~Phi5)/3.30",Size Parameters
233,204,"Given the formular (Phi16+Phi84-2Phi50)/2(Phi84-Phi16)+(Phi5+Phi95-2Phi50)/2(Phi95-Phi5), Skewness measures the degree of asymmetry as well as the sign, whether a curve has an asymmetrical tail on the left or right",Size Parameters
234,204,"Given the formula KG=(Phi95-Phi5)2.44(Phi75-Phi25), measures the ratio of the sorting in the extremes of the distribution compared with the sorting in the central part and as such is a sensitive and valuable test of the normality of a distribution",Size Parameters
