230,Median(Md),"Half of the particles by weight are coarser than the median, and half are finer. It is the diameter corresponding to the 50% mark on the cumulative curve and may be expressed either in Phi or mm (MdPhi or Mdmm)","Folk R L. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Hemphill Publishing Company, 1980"
231,Graphic mean (Mz),"The best graphic measure for determining overall size is the graphic mean, give by the formula Mz=(Phi16+Phi50+Phi84)/3","Folk R L. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Hemphill Publishing Company, 1980"
232,Sorting and Inclusive graphic standard deviation (sum1),"Given the formula (Phi84-Phi16)/4+(Phi95-Phi5)/6.6, This formula includes 90% of the distribution and is the best overall measure of sorting. It is simply the average of (I) the standard deviation computed from Phi16 and Phi84, and (2) the standard deviation as computed from Phi5 and Phi95-- since this interval (from 5 to 95%) embraces 3.30Phi, the standard deviation is found as (Phi195~Phi5)/3.30","Folk R L. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Hemphill Publishing Company, 1980"
233,Inclusive graphic skewness (Sk1),"Given the formular (Phi16+Phi84-2Phi50)/2(Phi84-Phi16)+(Phi5+Phi95-2Phi50)/2(Phi95-Phi5), Skewness measures the degree of asymmetry as well as the sign, whether a curve has an asymmetrical tail on the left or right","Folk R L. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Hemphill Publishing Company, 1980"
234,Kurtosis or Peakdeness (KG),"Given the formula KG=(Phi95-Phi5)2.44(Phi75-Phi25), measures the ratio of the sorting in the extremes of the distribution compared with the sorting in the central part and as such is a sensitive and valuable test of the normality of a distribution","Folk, Robert Louis, and William C. Ward. ""Brazos River bar [Texas]; a study in the significance of grain size parameters."" Journal of Sedimentary Research 27.1 (1957): 3-26"
