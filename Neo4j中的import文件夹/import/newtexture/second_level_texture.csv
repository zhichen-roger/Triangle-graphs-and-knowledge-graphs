204,Size ,The diameter of the grains.,"Wentworth C K. A scale of grade and class terms for clastic sediments. The journal of geology, 1922, 30(5): 377-392."
205,Roundness,"The roundness of a particle depends upon the sharpness of the edges and corners. The arithmetic mean of the roundness of the individual corners of a grain in the plane of measurement (a two-dimensional measure). The formula is Rw (roundness)=sum(r/R)/N, where r is the radius of curvature of individual corners, R is the radius of the maximum inscribed circle, and N is the number of corners.","Wadell H. Volume, shape, and roundness of rock particles[J]. The Journal of Geology, 1932, 40(5): 443-451."
206,Sphericity  ,"Sphericity, it states quantitatively how nearly equal the three dimensions of an object are.","Folk R L. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Hemphill Publishing Company, 1980."
207,Sorting,The sorting of a grain population is a measure of the range of grain sizes present and the magnitude of the spread or scatter of these sizes around the mean size. The mathematical expression of sorting is standard deviation. The formula for calculating the approximate standard deviation of a grain-size distribution by graphical-statistical methods. The formula of Phi standard deviation phi=(phi84-phi16)/4+(phi95-phi5)/6.6,"Boggs Jr S, Boggs S. Petrology of sedimentary rocks. Cambridge university press, 2009."
