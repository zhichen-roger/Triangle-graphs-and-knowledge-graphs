800,Gazzi-Dickinson method,A pointcounting method developed independently by Gazzi (1966) (discussed by Gazzi et al. 1973; Zuffa 1980) and Dickinson (1970) thatattempts to maximize information regarding source rocks in tectonically active settings. The basic criterion for counting the detrital framework  is separating coarse-grained lithic fragments (made up of single crystals more than 0.0625 mm in size) from fine-grained lithic fragments (made up of single crystals less than 0.0625 mm in size).,"Ingersoll, Raymond V., et al.
