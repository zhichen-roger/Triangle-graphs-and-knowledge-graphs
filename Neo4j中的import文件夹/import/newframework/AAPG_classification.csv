732,Volcanic lithic fragment,The matrix is typically glassy (non-crystalline) to crytocrystalline (fine crystalline). Plaque fibers are common (large crystals in fine-grained matrix). The phenocrysts in porphyry usually tend to be xenomorphic to hypautomorphic.,"Ulmer-Scholle, Dana S., et al. A color guide to the petrography of sandstones, siltstones, shales and associated rocks.

733,Plutonic lithic fragment,"Plutonic grains must contain two or more crystals as lithic, they are composed of phenocrystalline (large enough to be observed with the naked eye), and the crystals tend to be roughly the same size, usually anhedral-hypautomorphic.","Ulmer-Scholle, Dana S., et al.
