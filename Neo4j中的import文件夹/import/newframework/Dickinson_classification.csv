728,Felsitic,"Felsitic grains are an anhedral, microcrystalline mosaic, either granular or seriate, composed mainly of quartz and feldspar, and represent mainly silicic volcanic rocks, either lavas or tuffs.","Dickinson, William R. ""Interpreting detrital modes of graywacke and arkose."" Journal of Sedimentary Research 40.2 (1970): 695-707."
729,Microlitic,"Microlitic grains contain subhedral to enhedral feldspar plates and prisms in pilotaxitic, felted, trachytic, or hyalopilitic patterns of microlites, and represent mainly intermediate types of lava.","Dickinson, William R. ""Interpreting detrital modes of graywacke and arkose."" Journal of Sedimentary Research 40.2 (1970): 695-707."
730,Lathwork,Lathwork grains contain plagioclase laths in intergranular and intersertal textures representing mainly basaltic lavas.,"Dickinson, William R. ""Interpreting detrital modes of graywacke and arkose."" Journal of Sedimentary Research 40.2 (1970): 695-707"
731,Vitric,"Vitric to vitrophyric grains and shards are glass or altered glass, which may be phyllosilicates, zeolites, feldspars, silica minerals, or combinations of these in microcrystalline aggregates.","Dickinson, William R.
